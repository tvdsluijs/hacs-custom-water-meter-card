# Custom Water Meter Card for Home Assistant

The Custom Water Meter Card is a Lovelace UI card designed for Home Assistant. It visually represents water usage data, styled to mimic the appearance of a mechanical water meter, providing an aesthetic and functional display.

## Features

- **Aesthetic Display**: Styled to look like traditional mechanical water meters.
- **Color-coded Sections**: Separate colors for thousands (black background with white text) and liters (red background with white text).
- **Customizable and Configurable**: Easily adapt the card to display data from any water meter sensor in Home Assistant.

## Installation

To install the Custom Water Meter Card, you need to have Home Assistant running with HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) installed.

### Adding the Card to HACS

### Using the Card in Home Assistant

After installation, you need to add the card to your Lovelace dashboard:
